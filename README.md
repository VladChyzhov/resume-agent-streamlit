# Resume Agent Streamlit

Minimal Streamlit interface used in the course materials.

## Configuration

The app sends POST requests to a backend service. By default it expects the
backend to run at `http://localhost:8000`. You can override this by setting the
`BACKEND_URL` environment variable before starting the app.
